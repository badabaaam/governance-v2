# Proposal
Enable Notional fCash as a collateral for DAI and USDC loans.

# Background
Notional Finance allows fixed rate borrowing and lending, as does the Yield Protocol. There is an opportunity for arbitrage and leverage by integrating both platforms. As of now, lending rates exceed 5% in DAI and USDC for maturities that overlap those in the Yield Protocol. Borrowing rates in the Yield Protocol have often been well below 5%.


# Details
To enable fCash as a collateral we will be using a new ERC1155 compatible Join contract, a minimal module on the Ladle to transfer ERC1155 tokens, and an oracle that prices fCash at face value. Details on this integration can be found on the [vault](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2/blob/master/contracts/other/notional/README.md) repo.

The fCash maturities that will be accepted as collateral will be those for which a similar Yield series exists. FCash will be accepted as collateral to borrow only its underlying, with a collateralization ratio of 110%.

Steps:
1. [FCash Oracle deployment](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/7a35d72a64007a89b688d2e4d430744f9a58065b/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/addFCash-1.ts)
2. [ERC1155 Ladle module](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/7a35d72a64007a89b688d2e4d430744f9a58065b/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/addFCash-2.ts)
3. [ERC1155 Join deployments](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/7a35d72a64007a89b688d2e4d430744f9a58065b/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/addFCash-3.ts)
4. [FCash as collateral](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/7a35d72a64007a89b688d2e4d430744f9a58065b/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/addFCash-4.ts)
