# Proposal
Enable UNI as a collateral for DAI and USDC

# Background
UNI has a $9,697M market cap and 287K holders.

To enable UNI as a collateral we will be using the UNI/ETH chainlink price feed as a source of price data. 

# Details

**1. Add UNI as an asset using the Wand**

The [addUNI-1.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/ops/add-uni-collateral/scripts/operations/governance/addSimpleCollateral/addUNI-1.ts) script will be used, with this input:

```
  const uniAddress = new Map([
    [1, '0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984'],
    [42, '0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984'],
  ]) // https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/deploys.md
  
  const addedAssets: Array<[string, string]> = [[UNI, uniAddress.get(chainId) as string]]

```

**2. Configure the protocol**

The rest of the configuration will be condUNIed into a single proposal with the [addUNI-2.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/ops/add-uni-collateral/scripts/operations/governance/addSimpleCollateral/addUNI-2.ts) script, which includes these actions:

1. Orchestrate and configure oracles
2. Permission the UNIJoin
3. Make UNI into an Ilk
4. Approve UNI as collateral for all series

And these inputs:
```
  const CHAINLINK = 'chainlinkOracle'

  const uniAddress = new Map([
    [1, '0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984'],
    [42, '0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984'],
  ]) // https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/deploys.md

  const uniOracleAddress = new Map([
    [1, '0xD6aA3D25116d8dA79Ea0246c4826EB951872e02e'],
  ]) // https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/

  const wethAddress = new Map([
    [1, '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2'],
    [42, '0x55C0458edF1D8E07DF9FB44B8960AecC515B4492'],
  ]) // From assets.json in addresses archive

  // Input data: baseId, base address, quoteId, quote address, oracle name, source address
  const uniEthSource: Array<[string, string, string, string, string, string]> = [
    [
      UNI,
      uniAddress.get(chainId) as string,
      ETH,
      wethAddress.get(chainId) as string,
      CHAINLINK,
      uniOracleAddress.get(chainId) as string,
    ],
  ]
  
  // Input data: baseId, ilkId, oracle name, ratio (1000000 == 100%), inv(ratio), line, dust, dec
  const ilks: Array<[string, string, string, number, number, number, number, number]> = [
    [DAI, UNI, CHAINLINK, 2000000, 500000, 250000, 100, 18],
    [USDC, UNI, CHAINLINK, 2000000, 500000, 250000, 100, 6],
  ]
  // Input data: seriesId, [ilkId]
  const seriesIlks: Array<[string, string[]]> = [
    [stringToBytes6('0104'), [UNI]],
    [stringToBytes6('0105'), [UNI]],
    [stringToBytes6('0204'), [UNI]],
    [stringToBytes6('0205'), [UNI]],
  ]
```
# Testing
The change has been tested on a mainnet fork by posting UNI to all series, borrowing, repaying and wthdrawing. [Script](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/ops/add-uni-collateral/scripts/operations/governance/addSimpleCollateral/addUNI.test.ts).
