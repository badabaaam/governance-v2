# Proposal
Deploy the fyToken and pool contracts for the DAI and USDC June series

# Background
On December 31st 2021 the FYDAI2112 and FYUSDC2112 series will mature, and the YSDAI6MJD and YSUSDC6MJD strategies will stop accruing fees. To prepare for the maturity and rollover, the fyToken and pool contracts can already be deployed. The fyToken contracts won't be able to mint any tokens yet, effectively keeping both contracts disabled.

# Details

This deployment is an intermediate step as well in decommissioning the Wand and Factories. While the FYTokenFactory doesn't need to be used, to deploy the Pools without the PoolFactory would require a refactor of the Pool constructor which is beyond the risk apettite at this point. For this reason, we are premissioning the Timelock to deploy the Pools using the PoolFactory, in the way that the Wand would do it.

The [deployJuneSeries.mainnet.sh](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/3a4d77654ce5c5474b8b2a24693c7b68597f7a19/scripts/governance/addSeries/addJuneSeries/deployJuneSeries.mainnet.sh) script  will be used, with [this input](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/3a4d77654ce5c5474b8b2a24693c7b68597f7a19/scripts/governance/addSeries/addJuneSeries/addJuneSeries.mainnet.config.ts):

```
// Parameters to deploy fyToken with
// seriesId, underlyingId, chiOracleAddress, joinAddress, maturity, name, symbol
export const fyTokenData: Array<[string, string, string, string, number, string, string]> = [
  [FYDAI2206,  DAI,  protocol.get(COMPOUND) as string, joins.get(DAI) as string,  EOJUN22, 'FYDAI2206',  'FYDAI2206'],
  [FYUSDC2206, USDC, protocol.get(COMPOUND) as string, joins.get(USDC) as string, EOJUN22, 'FYUSDC2206', 'FYUSDC2206'],
]

// Pool fees to be set in the PoolFactory prior to pool deployment
// g1, g2
export const poolFees: [BigNumber, BigNumber] = [
  ONE64.mul(75).div(100), // Sell base to the pool
  ONE64.mul(100).div(75), // Sell fyToken to the pool
]

// Time stretch to be set in the PoolFactory prior to pool deployment
export const timeStretch: BigNumber = ONE64.div(secondsIn25Years)


// Pool fees to be set in the PoolFactory prior to pool deployment
// g1, g2
export const poolFees: [BigNumber, BigNumber] = [
  ONE64.mul(75).div(100), // Sell base to the pool
  ONE64.mul(100).div(75), // Sell fyToken to the pool
]

// Time stretch to be set in the PoolFactory prior to pool deployment
export const timeStretch: BigNumber = ONE64.div(secondsIn25Years)

```

The steps taken are five:
1. Deploy fyToken contracts
2. Set pool fees in PoolFactory
3. Set time stretch in the PoolFactory
4. Permission the PoolFactory for the Timelock to be able to create pools
5. Deploy pool contracts

```
