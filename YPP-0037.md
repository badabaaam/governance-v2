# Proposal
Set the initial offer for all assets with 18 decimals. Raise the auction limits for all assets.

# Background
The initial proportion for all assets was set with 6 decimals, when it needs 18, effectively rendering the first two thirds of any auction uneconomical, and compressing the auction into the last third.

# Details
The [updateAuctions.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/4bf6c0f8a2576da54d660e28679ff3c0104e4603/scripts/governance/update/updateAuctions/updateAuctions.ts) script will be used, with this input:
```
/// @notice Limits to be used in an auction
/// @param base identifier (bytes6 tag)
/// @param initial percentage of the collateral to be offered (fixed point with 6 decimals)
/// @param Maximum concurrently auctionable for this asset, modified by decimals
/// @param Minimum vault debt, modified by decimals
/// @param Decimals to append to auction ceiling and minimum vault debt.
export const newLimits: Array<[string, string, number, number, number]> = [
