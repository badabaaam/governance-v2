# Proposal

Support fyTokens as collateral

# Background

Contango.exchange is a decentralized derivatives exchange that synthetizes expirable futures by using fixed-rate borrowing and lending protocols.
Yield needs to support fyTokens as collateral for debt with a different underlying. Example: fyETH as collateral for a fyDAI debt.

# Details

To create a long position, Contango uses:
1. a flash swap on Uniswap to first get ETH 
2. lend ETH on Yield at a fixed rate
3. use the resulting fyETH token as collateral to borrow DAI/USDC. 

More info on this mechanism could be found on https://contango.gitbook.io/exchange/contango-protocol/borrowing-and-lending . A similar flow exists for short position by first lending DAI/USDC to borrow ETH.

Note: the fyTokens needs to be valuated using a TWAR oracle (both debt and collateral).
