Introduce FRAX as a borrowable asset.

# Background

You can find more details [here](https://gov.frax.finance/t/yield-protocol-frax-proposal-call-for-comments/835)

# Details

The summary of the execution is as follows:

1. Deploy Accumulator Oracle (no need for governance approval)
2. Deploy FRAX Join (no need for governance approval)
3. Deploy the FYFRAX2209 and FYFRAX2303 fyToken & pools (no need for governance approval)
4. Deploy YSFRAX1YEV and YSFRAX1YOD strategies (no need for governance approval)
5. Deploy OnChainTest (no need for governance approval)
6. Governance proposal
   a. Update chi and rate in accumulator oracle
   b. Update Chainlink sources
   c. Update sources in the Composite Oracle
   d. Update Paths in the Composite Oracle
   e. Add FRAX as an asset
   f. Make FRAX a base
   g. Approve DAI, USDC, WBTC, WSTETH, ENS and LINK as collaterals for FRAX using the Composite Oracle
   h. Approve ETH as collateral for FRAX using the Chainlink Oracle
   i. Add the FYFRAX2209 and FYFRAX2303 fyToken and pools as series
   j. Initialize the FYETH2206 and FYETH2209 pools with 100 FRAX each, and burn the LP tokens
   k. Orchestrate the YSETH6MMS and YSETH6MJD strategies
   l. Initialize the YSETH6MMS and YSETH6MJD strategies with 100 FRAX each, and burn the strategy tokens

These steps in 6 are encoded into the [addFraxSeries.ts](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/aeb8eb9d8f45052103f0514adef129616c27ebea/scripts/governance/addSeries/addFraxSeries/addFraxSeries.ts) scripts, while the steps 1 to 5 are the regular deployment scripts from the [environment deployment](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/tree/feat/eth-series/scripts/governance/redeploy).

[This input](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/aeb8eb9d8f45052103f0514adef129616c27ebea/scripts/governance/addSeries/addFraxSeries/addFraxSeries.mainnet.config.ts) will be used:
