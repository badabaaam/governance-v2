# Proposal
Raise DAI/ETH and USDC/ETH ceiling limits to 500K DAI and 500K USDC respectively

# Background
Due to unprecedented demand, the limits for borrowing DAI or USDC with ETH as collateral have already been reached.

At the same time, there haven't been any major incidents yet, and samczsun hasn't managed to hack Yield v2, so we feel more confident in the protocol.

# Details
The updateCeiling.ts script will be used, with this input:

```
/**
 * @dev Input file for updateCeiling.ts
 */

import { ETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC, USDT } from '../../../shared/constants'

// Input data: baseId, ilkId, maxDebt
export const newMax: Array<[string, string, number]> = [
  [DAI, ETH, 500000],
  [USDC, ETH, 500000],
]
```
