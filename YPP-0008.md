# Proposal
Remove all permissions from deployer.

# Background
The deployer account at 0xa072f81fea73ca932ab2b5eda31fa29306d58708 was used to deploy the protocol bypassing the multisig. Now it is a risk in that it is a single account with total control over the protocol. This proposal will remove all permissions from the deployer to remove that risk.
