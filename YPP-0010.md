# Proposal
Deploy a stEth/wstEth wrapper and integrate it with the Ladle to allow wrapping/unwrapping of stEth as part of a batch.

# Background
We already accept wstEth as a collateral, but the number of wstEth holders as compared to stEth holders is very small. Allowing to wrap stEth into wstEth as part of a batch would increase the potential impact of having stEth as a collateral.

# Details
The proposal includes two mainnet executions, the second one to be approved by the multisig.
1. Deploy the LidoWrapHandler using [this script](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/b22320ff59e342227724a4cb7ba98820a3db6d80/scripts/operations/utils/deployLidoWrapHandler.ts). The LidoWrapHandler doesn't have any relationship to the Yield Protocol, and knows only of the stEth and wstEth contracts.
2. Configure stEth, wstEth and the LidoWrapHandler in the Ladle, allowing to move stEth and wstEth tokens, and routing calls to the LidoWrapHandler. This configuration would be done with [this script](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/b22320ff59e342227724a4cb7ba98820a3db6d80/scripts/operations/governance/addWstETHWrapper/ypp-0010-2.ts).

# Testing
The testing can be done on a mainnet fork using [this script](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/b22320ff59e342227724a4cb7ba98820a3db6d80/scripts/operations/governance/addWstETHWrapper/ypp-0010.test.ts)
