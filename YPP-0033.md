# Proposal
Enable Notional fCash as a collateral for DAI and USDC loans, for the June and September maturities.

# Background
Notional Finance allows fixed rate borrowing and lending, as does the Yield Protocol. There is an opportunity for arbitrage and leverage by integrating both platforms. As of now, lending rates exceed 5% in DAI and USDC for maturities that overlap those in the Yield Protocol. Borrowing rates in the Yield Protocol have often been well below 5%.


# Details
Notional fCash is already enabled as a collateral, and with this proposal we are deploying new Joins and integrating new maturities.

The fCash maturities that will be accepted as collateral will be those for which a similar Yield series exists. FCash will be accepted as collateral to borrow only its underlying, with a collateralization ratio of 110%.

Steps:
1. [New fCash Joins](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/87b3939dabe4167b9c4c38c5634cd2e2405c17e4/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/deployNotionalJoins.ts)
2. [Integration of new fCash maturities](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/environments-v2/blob/87b3939dabe4167b9c4c38c5634cd2e2405c17e4/scripts/governance/addFCashCollateral/addFCashMaturities/addFCashMaturities.ts)
